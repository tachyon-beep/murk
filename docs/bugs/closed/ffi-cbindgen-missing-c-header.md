# Bug Report

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Reporter:** bead-triage (migrated from murk-5pe)
**Severity:** [ ] Critical | [ ] High | [ ] Medium | [x] Low (P4 — feature request)

## Summary

murk-ffi exposes 28+ `extern "C"` functions but no generated C header. C consumers must hand-write their own declarations, which is error-prone and drifts as the API evolves.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Build murk-ffi
2. Look for a generated `murk.h` — none exists
3. C consumer must manually declare all 28+ function signatures

## Expected Behavior

A `murk.h` header is auto-generated by cbindgen from the Rust source, shipped in release artifacts, and regenerated in CI on every build.

## Actual Behavior

No generated header exists. C consumers must write and maintain their own declarations.

## Reproduction Rate

Always

## Environment

- **OS:** Any
- **Rust toolchain:** stable
- **Murk version/commit:** HEAD (feat/release-0.1.7)

## Determinism Impact

- [x] Bug is deterministic (same inputs always reproduce it)
- [ ] Bug is non-deterministic (flaky / timing-dependent)
- [ ] Replay divergence observed

## Additional Context

**Migrated from:** `.beads/issues.jsonl` entry `murk-5pe` (P3 feature, created 2026-02-16)
**Suggested approach:**
1. Add `cbindgen` as a build dependency with a `cbindgen.toml` config
2. Generate `murk.h` in a `build.rs` or CI step
3. Include the header in release artifacts alongside the shared library
4. Consider also generating a `murk.hpp` C++ wrapper with RAII handle types
