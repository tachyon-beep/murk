## Summary

`World::step` can panic with an out-of-bounds slice when FFI reports more receipts than the local receipt buffer capacity. The FFI helper `write_receipts` truncates the number of receipts *written* to `min(receipts.len(), cap)`, but sets `*n_out = receipts.len()` (the total count, not the written count). The Python wrapper then slices `receipts_buf[..n_receipts]` without clamping, causing a panic when `n_receipts > receipts_cap`.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a world with one or more propagators.
2. Submit zero commands (or fewer commands than the number of receipts generated by internal sources).
3. Call `world.step(None)` or `world.step([])` when the engine produces receipts from sources other than the submitted commands (e.g., rollback receipts).
4. The `receipts_cap` is set to `n_cmds.max(1)` which may be smaller than the actual receipt count.

## Expected Behavior

The Python wrapper should handle the case where `n_receipts > receipts_cap` gracefully, either by clamping to the written count, re-allocating, or raising a descriptive error.

## Actual Behavior

Rust panics with index-out-of-bounds when slicing `receipts_buf[..n_receipts]` because `n_receipts` can exceed `receipts_buf.len()`.

## Reproduction Rate

- Deterministic when the engine produces more receipts than the buffer capacity.

## Environment

- **OS:** Any
- **Rust toolchain:** stable
- **Murk version/commit:** HEAD (feat/release-0.1.7)
- **Python version (if murk-python):** 3.10+

## Determinism Impact

- [x] Bug is deterministic (same inputs always reproduce it)
- [ ] Bug is non-deterministic (flaky / timing-dependent)
- [ ] Replay divergence observed

## Logs / Backtrace

```
N/A - found via static analysis
```

## Minimal Reproducer

```python
import murk

# Any scenario where receipts.len() > n_cmds.max(1)
# For example, step with no commands when engine generates rollback receipts
config = murk.Config()
# ... configure world ...
world = murk.World(config)
receipts, metrics = world.step(None)  # receipts_cap = 1, but n_receipts could be > 1
```

## Additional Context

**Source report:** /home/john/murk/docs/bugs/generated/crates/murk-python/src/world.rs.md
**Verified lines:** `crates/murk-python/src/world.rs:82,124`, `crates/murk-ffi/src/world.rs:337,349`
**Root cause:** FFI `write_receipts` sets `*n_out = receipts.len()` (total count) but only writes `min(receipts.len(), cap)` entries. Python wrapper does not clamp before slicing.
**Suggested fix:** Clamp before slicing: `let written = n_receipts.min(receipts_buf.len());` and build receipts from `receipts_buf[..written]`. Optionally log or return a warning if truncation occurred.
